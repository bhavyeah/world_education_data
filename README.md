# World Education Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes global education data to uncover trends in literacy, enrollment, and unemployment, providing insights into educational disparities and policy recommendations.

## Insights Derived from the Data
- **Birth Rates:** Niger, Chad, and Somalia have the highest birth rates, while Monaco, South Korea, and San Marino have the lowest.
- **Unemployment Rates:** South Africa, Lesotho, and Saint Lucia have the highest unemployment rates.
- **Education Enrollment:** On average, 49% of males and 51% of females worldwide are not enrolled in pre-primary, primary, secondary, or higher education.
- **Reading Proficiency:**
  - Students from Russia, Austria, and Kazakhstan have the highest reading proficiency at the end of primary education.
  - Students from Niger, Chad, and Madagascar have the lowest reading proficiency.
- **Literacy Correlations:**
  - There is a strong positive correlation between male and female literacy rates among youths aged 15-24.
  - Female primary education completion rates have a weak or inconsistent correlation with reading proficiency, indicating that primary education alone does not guarantee strong reading skills for women.

## Educational Policy Recommendations
### 1. Increase Access to Education in High Birth Rate Countries
- Implement **universal primary education** in **Niger, Chad, and Somalia** to improve educational outcomes and raise awareness about population growth.

### 2. Strengthen Early Education Enrollment
- With **high non-enrollment rates (49% males, 51% females)**, governments should introduce **subsidies, awareness campaigns, and community-based programs** to increase school attendance.

### 3. Address Unemployment through Vocational Training
- In **South Africa, Lesotho, and Saint Lucia**, integrating **skills-based training** in the school curriculum can enhance employability.

### 4. Improve Reading Proficiency in Low-Performing Countries
- In **Niger, Chad, and Madagascar**, emphasis on **teacher training, improved learning materials, and literacy programs** is essential to enhance reading skills.

### 5. Ensure Literacy Equality for Both Genders
- Since **male and female literacy rates are strongly correlated**, **gender-inclusive policies** should be implemented to bridge gaps in educational access.

### 6. Go Beyond Primary Education for Reading Skills
- Since **primary education completion does not guarantee strong reading proficiency**, **reading intervention programs and continuous skill assessments** should be introduced, particularly for young girls.

## Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive data exploration.
- **Statistical Analysis** for correlation and trend identification.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights critical global education challenges and provides actionable policy recommendations for governments and organizations to improve educational outcomes.
